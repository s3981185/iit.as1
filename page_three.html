                <p>
                    Job: Network Engineer | Global Education Provider
                    
                    <br><br> 
                    A network engineer’s responsibility is to ensure network systems are configured and optimised whilst also being able to troubleshoot and fix any issues. In this case, it is specified that the key role and duties they seek in new employees is the ability to optimise, manage and support the organization’s network. The recruitment posting also mentions the opportunity to work from home while staff provide either Business-as-Usual (BAU) support, work on IT projects or both. The role is defined as a comprehensive team-based position assisting WAN/LAN, Wireless, Cloud Networking and Security. 
                    The central duties a network engineer is expected to deliver include contributing to maintaining and developing the company’s network environment, through troubleshooting any technical issues that may arise from a complex network. Another part of the role is providing levels 2 and 3 technical supports for network infrastructure, such as routers and firewalls, and being able to deliver on various network projects like upgrades and deployments, for example. <br>
                    <br>What appeals most about this line of work is the fact that it’s a more technical or hardware involved type of job, that goes beyond the clients and code. Often, it is a network engineers’ duty to set up, maintain and upgrade communication systems, local networks and large-scale networks. Helping ensure such critical systems work and troubleshooting software or hardware is a big part of the charm for me. A role like this also flexing from creating and implementing new projects as well as maintaining and supporting current business operations, with the option from home, makes for a flexible work style that suits me whilst also keeping things somewhat fresh and offering a decent payout. This role does, however, require specialist network knowledge, certifications and experience. Currently, I do not possess many hard skills, qualifications or experience relevant for a position of this regard, but time in retail and personal hobbies have built a reputable foundation for being a friendly team player who enjoys problem-solving and tackling issues. 
                    <br><br>To qualify for this role specifically, previous experience handling complex commercial networks will need to be proven, which may be acquired through an internship with a notable company. An internship will also be an apt opportunity to develop and demonstrate experience in problem solving, troubleshooting and working as a team player. Exhibiting network knowledge may be achievable through successful completion of a Bachelor of IT, undertaking subjects such as cloud computing or data communication. Obtaining a Cisco Certified Network Associate (CCNA) certificate will be necessary as well, to acquire skills and knowledge familiar with Cisco related hardware and software. A timeline might look similar to graduating RMIT with a Bachelors of IT by 2025, taking some time to study and getting a CCNA certification before going for an internship. This should lead to applying for a junior or entry-level role as a network engineer to gain workplace experience for at least a year.

            <h1>Project Idea</h1>
            <p>
                My project idea is that of a dating app for iOS and Android based on users leaving reviews of other users. The online dating world is already saturated with many dating apps lead by goliaths such as Tinder, Bumble and Hinge becoming the norm, however, none of these allow for input between users. Allowing users to leave reviews of another’s profile, chat experience or date experience allows others to form greater expectations or ideas of that user. 
                This concept seeks to better inform potential matches beyond the basic profile, one usually built with highlight photos and bios specifically crafted to garner attention. With over 300 million people worldwide across a plethora of dating apps, many are left feeling frustrated or pessimistic with their efforts, many leave after being “ghosted” or left unmatched and aren’t guaranteed a reason why. People seeking a connection on platforms like Tinder, Bumble, Hinge and Badoo lack the easy opportunity to provide feedback and share their thoughts about others with others, that we seek to provide.
            </p>

            <div class="flex-container seperator" >
                <div class="flex-child3">
                        Dating apps are inherently based on user interaction, so to represent the user, profiles including the name, age, character-limited biography and a photo(s) and the main user interface will be the first milestone. The central emphasis of the UI will be the basic details and the reviews, with an option for the user to bring up and view the user’s profile. 1-3 anonymous reviews of both negative and positive will appear per profile. Reviews themselves will be prompted and text-only to combat public metric-based ratings. 
                </div>
                
                <div class="flex-child3">
                    The app will use a familiar concept of swiping to indicate whether they are interested in someone or not, swiping left to not match with that person or swiping right to match with them. If two users swipe right on each other, they get matched, and an inbox becomes available between the two. Settings to optimise the application for the users’ device will also be necessary to create the optimal user experience. 
                </div>
        
                <div class="flex-child3">
                        To support a matchmaking algorithm, the app will need access to the device’s location, tracking the devices ID through activity which determines its position through GPS data processed by Android and Apple Location Services. This also means an internet connection is required. The order of deliveries may have to be switched as the initial concept requires other users to leave reviews and a lack of a userbase may need to be countered otherwise.   
                </div>

                <div class="flex-child3">
                    Future versions will seek to improve matchmaking through the implementation of prompts and preferences. For example, users can select hobbies, activities, religions, etc. and other users with the same tags will be appear more frequently. More features to return and view someone who was previously indicated to not match with may be an added benefit for some.  
                </div>
            </div>

            <p> 
                However, a lot can go wrong in an online app set in a reality where everyone is free to say what they want, even if they shouldn’t. This leaves room for problems that plague many dating apps in the current industry such as spam, bots and people who deliberately leave irrelevant or offensive comments. Such disingenuous reviews will need to be handled in the appropriate manner with warnings, timeouts and bans. Strict moderation will need to be enforced on reviews, biographies and chat messages, flagging key words or phrases to ensure users aren’t abusing, harassing or intentionally leaving defamatory reviews. Implementation of first level and second level account authentication verifying phone numbers and emails, as well as the user being of age. 
                <br><br>
                This application will build on this already established basis and create a platform where it’s more than what you say on your profile and what pictures you’ve selected to show off, and rather, how you interact with and around others. Positive reviews are more likely to get a user more matches while negative reviews provide an opportunity for the user to improve.

                Physical servers will be needed to host databases that will store information on user accounts, preferences, images, the reviews themselves, matches and chat logs. 
                Efficiency and knowledge in common design practices and in writing functional and maintainable code will be necessary for the design of software. 
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="flex-child2">
            <p>
                Ensuring the application is scalable too will not be easy but a necessary step none-the-less, to ensure growth and use of the app. This means certifying that a potential large sum of users is all able to interact with the app without issues or failures. An algorithm will also need to be created in order to display potential matches to users based on their preferences and location. 
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="flex-child2">
            <p>
                Handling personal information means that for the app to be trusted, their data needs to be protected, so knowledge of cyber security, encryption and the like will also need to be implemented.
                Interpersonal communication is an integral aspect of dating apps making it essential to be familiar with concepts of networking. Being knowledgeable of communication protocols and understanding how users can send and receive messages for example, will be important.

        <div class="flex-child2">

                An IDE for the development of the application will be required such as Visual Studio Code from Microsoft with its tools in debugging, syntax highlighting, and general ease-of-use and power. XCode is also recommended for the development of apps on iOS while Android studio is another option for Android devices. Competency with Git will be necessary to handle version control.
