                        <p>
                            Born and raised in North-West Tasmania, I was raised in a fairly typical Australian environment growing up but was lucky enough to experience other cultures with my mother being Filipino and my father, British and German. My youth was shared with two younger brothers and one younger sister.

                        <p>
                            Though I have made many endeavours in trying new hobbies, my favourite pass times include volleyball, gaming and watching an abhorrent number of films and shows. I have a thorough fascination with Japan - its history, media, achievements, literature, atrocities, nature and culture, are all aspects of the nation I have been engrossed in and desperately seek to travel there someday and experience it all for myself. Having my parents come from foreign countries, I would also like to visit countries like the Philippines, Germany and the United Kingdom, among many more. While I have flown out to the Philippines in my youth, I recount very little as I was too young to remember.

                    <h2>Interest in IT</h2>
                    <p>
                        My interest in IT begins at a young age, around the time of my first computer and introduction into video games. Ever since, technology in my house continued to get replaced with newer and better pieces of hardware and software and it never ceased to pique my curiosity. It always seemed a case of ‘out with the old, in with the new’ so in my spare time I’d enjoy taking apart those old phones or laptops, just to look inside and maybe try to understand what made these devices run. Learning how each component affects another and contributes to the overall system was fun and something I’ve carried with me until today. 
                        Having gaming as a major hobby, seeing the world move more online during COVID and in general, seeing how the future can be shaped with advancing technologies helped encourage a desire to learn more. In video games, endless capabilities can be experienced, with entire virtual words with increasingly realistic visuals, gripping epic tales and subtle poignant stories, has always just blown my mind. This is definitely part of the appeal to me, to see how much creativity and technical expertise is expressed in not just video games but software or artificial intelligence, etc. 
                    </p>
                    

                    <h3>Why did you choose to come to RMIT?</h3>
                    <p>
                        I intended to study online through OUA regardless, due to how well it fits my personality, lifestyle and current circumstances. It just so happens that compared to other universities with online capabilities, RMIT had the best course structure and selection of units for me. Also, being located in Melbourne meant that there weren’t any issues with time zones.  </p>

                    <h3>What do you expect to learn during your studies?</h3>
                    <p>
                        During my studies I expect to learn the skills needed of someone who is to work in the current day IT industry. This means understanding how project development works, what the industry expects and how it can affect myself and the world around me. I’d like to be able to solve general ICT issues for myself and others, which entails learning how to analyse a problem and having the knowledge to fix it. Learning to program with languages such as Python, Java or something potentially more specific, and being able to think more logically, yet cultivate an ‘outside-the-box’ mentality are key goals of mine. Of course, my main objective in this course is to expand my current knowledge and deepen my understanding of IT, to see how far I can get and potentially pursue a career.
