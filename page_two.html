                        The MBTI personality test concluded that I am an INFP-T, or a mediator, highlighting that we are “quiet or unassuming” on the surface, yet lively and creative underneath. What I’ve gathered is that the test has confirmed most of what I’ve been told and what I hold to be true, traits I feel are demonstrated on the regular: open-mindedness, empathy, introspectiveness and creativity. With a strong emphasis of the initial three, I do my best to approach everything with an open-minded, non-judgemental attitude. The weaknesses of this type also correlate to personal reflections of being too self-critical, unrealistic and unfocused, introspection especially being a double-edged sword if you’re only beating yourself down. What this test highlights for the most part is that INFP’s value peace and fairness between one another by being empathetic and open-minded.

            <p>
                In workplace conditions, brainstorming ideas may prove to be a struggle due to the fact of being too self-critical and always second-guessing every thought. In most cases, I do tend to be reluctant on sharing thoughts and ideas. Having unrealistic expectations of myself and remaining unfocused could potentially have a negative impact on productivity, which could lead to failures on meeting deadlines and being unable to pull through on my part in the group. Though I feel this scenario is merely an extreme.
                To overcome this, ensuring that my role and objective is clearly defined within the group encourages less time thinking about the possible negatives. Feedback is also highly valuable, of which is encouraging yet also constructive helps so that I understand what I should keep doing and what shouldn’t. A relaxed work environment also goes a long way, where a casual or relaxed setting makes for an easier environment to share and discuss information. 
                <br><br> To summarise, I believe in a group setting, the positives outweigh the negatives where the downsides outlined above mostly affect myself and group members should remain not too affected. With the open-minded mentality and empathetic nature, getting along in most groups should not be too challenging a task but, as a more reserved person, I may have to step out of my comfort zone and take some initiative to clarify any misunderstandings and the like, as any student would.

                <h1>Honey and Mumford Learning Styles</h1>
                
                <p> 
                    My results for the quiz based on the Honey and Mumford Learning Styles shows that I am predominately attuned to the reflector style, at 45%, and the pragmatist style at 33.5%. According to the description of the reflector style, I have somewhat of a passive learning style and tend to take the back seat and observe. Reflectors are keen to carefully and extensively gather and investigate information with considerable time and effort to gain a greater understanding and “see the bigger picture” through said research and even prior experience too. I express this as a desire to be thorough and often spend more time in my head working through ideas than expressing them in other ways. I heavily agree that I lean towards the reflector side of things, where methods of learning include self-analysis, coaching, feedback and demonstrations. 
                    Within a team, I feel this description aligns with being a keen listener and observer, which is a skill I feel strong in. To reflectors and me, it might not be unfamiliar to keep thoughts to ourselves and think them over before sharing, and when such insights or reflections are eventually shared, they are thought-out and hopefully well-reasoned. Reflectors need this extra time to assess and discern what exactly is the goal and how to get there, before taking steps forward. An example in real life is my volleyball team that I captain, where I will constantly be watching myself and my teammates and analysing what mistakes we’re making, thinking of the best ways to improve and contemplating the best approach to deliver my thoughts. For me, this is a process that involves watching how others interact with new concepts that internalizes an idea of how I could approach the same with my own method. While I think this approach is useful for feedback and improvements, it can be difficult to keep up with deadlines and urgent business. Maximising the time for a reflector to ponder would be ideal, but under time constraints and the needs of other members, limiting this thinking stage may be necessary to compromise between team members and the goal.

                <p class="text-correction">
                    I do believe it is worth noting that sometimes, I don’t need a lot of reflection when a solid grasp of the ideas is already had yet struggles to apply the concepts. This coincides with my secondary learning style: a pragmatist. This is someone who needs to visualise how the learning aspect applies to the real world and puts the learning to the test. Personally, I can relate to times where I don’t have all the information or struggle to apply the logic to different scenarios and the best course is to experiment or try out a half-baked idea, see where it leads and reflect upon it. Testing or justifying new or different techniques helps someone like myself, assess its relevancy towards the ideas. While in order to let knowledge ‘sink in’ it takes a full cycle or more of each stage, I feel that I am comfortable with the reflector learning style and share a familiarity with certain attributes of the pragmatist style too.

            <h2>IPIP Big Five Factor Markers</h2>

                <img class="five_factors_img flex-child" src="./imgs/five-factors.png" alt="">
                
                    <p>
                        The third online test I undertook was that of the IPIP Big Five Factor Markers, a test based on a study of responses to questions describing various personality traits. These were condensed or summarised into five notable factors being extroversion, emotional stability or neuroticism, agreeableness, conscientiousness and openness or intellect/imagination. 
                        Looking at my results summary, it is evident that the outcomes align with prior tests, with a lack of extroversion being the lowest raw score and agreeableness at the highest. While I agree with this notion of being friendly and optimistic, I find being critical and pessimistic can also be shared as traits. 
                    </p>
                
            </div>
            
            <p>
                The same can be said for factor IV, conscientiousness, and factor V, intellect/imagination, where someone who scores higher are considered careful, diligent and creative. I think the fact that the raw scores which float around the middle show that people who score similar to myself, usually demonstrate such traits but can also equally feel inclined to exhibit other traits, such as being disorganized compared to being diligent. The characteristics attributed with each factor show opposites of a spectrum, higher being this and lower being that, but these are not absolutes when knowing how fickle and complicated human nature is.
                <br><br>
                In a team-based setting, being almost in the middle of factors IV and V show that one can provide insight and understanding for those that skew more towards one side. For a team to work well together, being agreeable and friendly to an extent, is important for communicating potential insights appropriately. For me, a high score in factor III also indicates an understanding of the importance of getting along with other team members and staying open to other ideas ensures that you keep getting along with them. A team where members are constantly disapproving, questioning or putting down other ideas is not nearly going to achieve the same level or quality than a team who works well together.
